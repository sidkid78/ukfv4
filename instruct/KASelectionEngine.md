# 1. Architecture & Data Flow Overview

## 1.1 Frontend-Backend Data Lifecycle

**Frontend (Next.js App Router):**
- Sends: user query (text), user/session id, params (may include location or KA overrides).

**Backend (FastAPI + Orchestrator):**
- **/api/query** endpoint calls `AppOrchestrator.process_request`, which orchestrates the following steps:

1. **Axis/context analysis** (`ThirteenAxisQueryWorkflow`): Determines query axes (regulatory, domain, location, etc).
2. **Location context extraction** (`LocationContextEngine`): Hierarchical location UIDs for Axis 12.
3. **Query topic UID creation** (`UnitedSystemManager`): Unique per-query identity, cross-logging anchor.
4. **KA selection** (`KASelectionEngine`): Chooses best-fit KAs based on axis and location.
5. **KA execution** (`KnowledgeAlgorithmLoader`): Runs algorithms, yielding confidence-tagged outputs.
6. **Enrichment of simulation_data**: All the above context/outputs are logged and packaged for simulation.
7. **Logging**: All critical steps/events are logged to `StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)`.
8. **Simulation passes** (`SimulationEngine`): simulation_data is processed through cognition layers.
9. **Gap analysis** (`SEKREngine`): At pass breakpoints or per policy, analyzes logs and graph structure to propose ontology improvements.

**SMM logs every major action, proposal, and result with UIDs, context, action type, and confidence.**

---

# 2. Implementation: KASelectionEngine & Initial Workflow

## 2.1 Where to Extend

- The **KASelectionEngine** integration goes immediately *after* axis analysis, location resolution, and topic UID creation, but *before* the main simulation loop in `AppOrchestrator.process_request`.
- All actions are logged, and simulation_data is built with full, enriched context.

## 2.2 Example Scaffold

```python
def process_request(self, user_query, user_id, session_id, simulation_params=None):
    # 1. Axis/context analysis
    axis_context = self.thirteen_axis_workflow.run()                  # {'resolved_axis_context': {...}}
    
    # 2. Location (Axis 12 extraction)
    explicit_loc_uids = simulation_params.get("location_uids_override") if simulation_params else None
    location_uids = self.location_context_engine.determine_active_location_context(
        query_text=user_query, explicit_location_uids=explicit_loc_uids
    )
    
    # 3. Query topic UID
    axis_scores = {
        axis: score for axis, score in axis_context.get("resolved_axis_context", {}).items()
        if score > 0.5
    }
    query_uid_pkg = self.united_system_manager.create_unified_id(
        entity_label=user_query[:60],
        entity_type="UserQueryTopic",
        ukg_coords=axis_scores,
    )
    topic_uid = query_uid_pkg["uid_string"]
    
    # 4. Logging context to SMM
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, "axis_resolution", {"axes": axis_context}, topic_uid, 0.98)
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, "location_resolution", {"locations": location_uids}, topic_uid, 1.0)
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, self.united_system_manager.uid_registry_entry_type,
        query_uid_pkg, topic_uid, 1.0)

    # 5. KA selection and logging
    selected_kas = self.ka_selection_engine.select_k_a_for_task(
        axis_context, "L0_InitialQueryUnderstanding", location_uids
    )
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, "ka_selection_stage_0", {"selected_ka_ids": selected_kas}, topic_uid, 1.0)
    
    # 6. KA execution, per-KA logging
    initial_ka_outputs = {}
    for ka_id in selected_kas:
        ka_input = {
            "raw_query_text": user_query,
            "query_topic_uid": topic_uid,
            "axis_context": axis_context.get("resolved_axis_context"),
            "active_location_context_uids": location_uids,
        }
        ka_result = self.ka_loader.execute_ka(ka_id, ka_input)
        initial_ka_outputs[f"KA{ka_id}_output"] = ka_result
        self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
            session_id, 0, 0, f"initial_KA{ka_id}_result", ka_result, topic_uid, ka_result.get("ka_confidence", 0.8)
        )

    # 7. Build simulation_data, log snapshot
    simulation_data = {
        "query": user_query, "user_id": user_id, "session_id": session_id, "current_pass": 0,
        "query_topic_uid": topic_uid, "normalized_query": user_query.lower().strip(),
        "initial_axis_context_scores": axis_context.get("resolved_axis_context"),
        "initial_ka_outputs": initial_ka_outputs,
        "active_location_context_uids": location_uids,
        "expanded_knowledge_scope_uids": [topic_uid],
        "current_confidence": 0.65,
        "primary_location_label_for_display":
            (self.ukg_graph_manager.get_node_data_by_uid(location_uids[0]).get("label")
             if location_uids else None),
    }
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, "simulation_data_initial_snapshot", simulation_data, topic_uid, 1.0)
    
    # 8. Hand-off to SimulationEngine
    # simulation_data = self.simulation_engine.run_layers_1_3(simulation_data)
    # ...
```
**All thresholds, axis names, KA mappings, etc., come from config (YAML/settings) loaded at init.  
Every major event/context is logged, creating a persistent queryable audit trail.**

# 3. SEKREngine: Advanced Gap Analysis (Dynamic Evolution)

## 3.1 Extended Method Example

```python
def _analyze_for_gaps(self, simulation_context_summary: dict = None) -> list:
    gaps_found = []
    # --- 1. Find low-confidence SMM outputs
    low_confs = self.smm.query_memory(
        entry_type="final_compiled_answer",
        max_confidence_below=self.low_confidence_query_threshold)
    for entry in low_confs:
        gap = {"gap_type": "LOW_CONFIDENCE_AREA", "details": ..., "triggering_uid_context": ..., "priority": 1}
        gaps_found.append(gap)
        self.smm.add_memory_entry(..., entry_type="sekre_action_log", content={"action": "detect_gap", "gap_detail": gap, ...})
    # --- 2. Sparse Pillar nodes in GM
    for pl_uid in sample_some_pillars(self.gm):
        num_children = len(list(self.gm.graph.successors(pl_uid)))
        if num_children < self.sparse_node_neighbor_threshold:
            gap = {"gap_type": "SPARSE_PILLAR_DEFINITION", ...}
            gaps_found.append(gap)
            self.smm.add_memory_entry(..., entry_type="sekre_action_log", content={"action": "detect_gap", "gap_detail": gap, ...})
    # --- 3. (Optionally) Find underperforming KAs via SMM log stats
    ...
    return gaps_found
```
- Each gap triggers an SMM log with full detail for traceability.
- All related thresholds/configs are SMM/GM-injected via central config.
- Add extension hooks for axis/domain-specific gap checks via registry.

---

# 4. Required and Refined Interfaces: SMM, GM, USM, Validator

## 4.1 StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)
- `query_memory(entry_type=None, max_confidence_below=None, **kwargs)`: Filter for low-confidence or type-based log returns.
- `add_memory_entry(session_id, pass_num, layer_num, entry_type, content, uid=None, confidence=1.0)`: Centralized logging.
- Optional: `query_ka_usage_summary(ka_id=None, axis_uid=None)` for KA performance analytics.

## 4.2 GraphManager (GM)
- `get_pillar_level_uid(original_id)` → UID: Map pillar level names to graph UIDs.
- Graph methods: `.graph.has_node(uid)`, `.graph.successors(uid)`, `.degree(uid)`: Networkx standard.
- `get_node_data_by_uid(uid)` → dict: Node metadata for logs, proposals.

## 4.3 UnitedSystemManager (USM)
- `create_unified_id(entity_label, entity_type, ukg_coords=None, specific_id_part=None)` → dict
- `uid_registry_entry_type` (property): Type string for UID registry entries in SMM.

## 4.4 SimulationValidator
- `validate_proposal(proposal: dict) -> dict`: Returns:
    ```python
    {
        "proposal_uid": ...,
        "simulated_confidence": float,
        "integration_complexity_score": float,
        "potential_conflicts": int,
        ...
    }
    ```

---

# 5. Modularity, Logging, Config, and Extension Practices

- **All thresholds** (confidence for gaps, pillar sparsity, etc.) come from injected config.
- **All logging** is routed through SMM with a helper per engine, always referencing UID/session/layer/pass for traceability.
- **Extension Points:** 
    - New axes? Just update config and dictionaries, no hardcoding needed.
    - New location or axis-specific gap checks? Register via per-engine registries (`ext_gap_check_registry`).
    - Alternate proposal/validation logic? Swap out or layer new hooks via interface.

Driver code is kept thin; all logic is inside engines/modules, easily testable and replaceable for new features (LLMs, remote KAs, future memory backends).

---

# 6. Documentation, Extension, and End-to-End Audit

- **Code comments/docstrings** explicitly tag all extension points—future team members add axes, gap checkers, KAs, validation policies via registry or config.
- **simulation_data** is always enriched, passed to all downstream layers, never siloed—ensuring context propagation and enabling advanced auditing.
- **SMM logs** provide a persistent, queryable audit trail for every event, algorithm, and ontology evolution proposal. Each KA run, axis analysis, location resolution, gap, and proposal is cross-referenced for audit/replay/testing.
- **Validator module** is called by interface, so can be replaced by full simulation pass, LLM, or manual review in future.

---

# 7. Example: SMM/Persistent Log Query

```python
# Audit all gaps/detections for topic_uid 'XYZ'
gaps = smm.query_memory(entry_type="sekre_action_log", uid="XYZ")
# Find all KA runs for session X
ka_runs = smm.query_memory(entry_type__startswith="initial_KA", session_id="X")
```

# 9. Next Steps and Best Practices

- **Implement/verify required interfaces** in SMM, GM, USM, and validator (see specs above).
- **Register all logs and important events** with UIDs/session and typed entry fields in SMM.
- **Load all config** for thresholds/policies from central YAML or .env—never hardcode criteria.
- **Clearly document** all extension points in code, and keep simulation_data design forward-compatible.
- **Test gap analysis/proposal cycles** with mock/test data, ensure logs are queryable.
- **When integrating new axes/KAs/inference layers**, only update config + extension registries, not orchestration skeleton.

**With this architecture and documentation, your platform is modular, audit-ready, and future-proof for all advanced AI and simulation needs.**

*If you need example test scripts/unit test patterns, or FastAPI/Next.js endpoint integration stubs, just ask!*

## Intermediate Steps

### Task Coordinator

Task Understanding:
Integrate the KASelectionEngine into the AppOrchestrator's initial query processing loop in a Python FastAPI + Next.js App Router project, and enhance SEKREngine's gap analysis. The goal is to enable targeted knowledge algorithm selection before the simulation, enrich initial simulation context, and support dynamic ontology evolution based on low-confidence detection and knowledge graph sparsity—without yet implementing test execution. Additionally, the plan must account for multi-layer location (Axis 12) context, cross-module logging, modular code extensibility, and clear dependencies between back-end engines, graph management, and simulation cycles.

Execution Strategy:
Start with architectural mapping and documentation. Next, implement KASelectionEngine hooks and SEKREngine gap analysis extensions in the codebase, but only as module logic/layer intercepts (defer real KA execution/testing for later). Specify new interface signatures in memory/graph modules as needed, with mocks or placeholders. Modularize all new code, log actions to the SMM, and ensure all configuration is loaded from central config files. Finish with clear in-code and external documentation describing data flow, new module extension points, and dependencies for future integration and testing.

   Dependencies: 2, 3
5. Modularize and Future-Proof Code—Logging, Config, and Extension Points (Priority: 4, Expertise: Python Lead Developer, Clean Code & OSS Best Practices)
   Description: Ensure new logic (KASelection, gap analysis, proposals) is modular, with clean logging (to SMM/in logs), config-driven thresholds, and extensibility for future test execution, proposal validators, LLM or KA integration, and cross-layer persistent audit. Document extension points in code, e.g. for Axis 12, future KAs, or alternate memory engines.

### Lead System Architect (backend, ONTOLOGY, OSS AI/ML) Specialist

Certainly! Here is a structured, thorough response for the assigned subtask—**Review Architectural Requirements and Data Flows**—as applied to your FastAPI (backend), Next.js App Router (frontend), and UKG-based (Unified Knowledge Graph) application.

---

# I. High-Level Architectural Overview

Let's start by mapping core components relevant to the described workflow and how they interact:

### 1.1 FastAPI Back-end
- **Purpose**: Hosts the main API endpoints called by the Next.js app.
- **Key Endpoints**: 
    - `/api/query`: Accepts user queries, user/session data, simulation parameters.
- **AppOrchestrator**: Primary orchestrator class, called in `/api/query`, manages full simulation lifecycle per request.

### 1.2 Next.js App Router (Frontend)
- **Purpose**: Presents the user interface, collects queries, displays results, manages session state/client routing.
- **Interaction**: Calls backend API endpoints (`/api/query`) with payload (query, user info, parameters).
- **Note**: Logic is primarily client-side, but must pass through all relevant context.

### 1.3 Core Engines and Managers (Python Backend)
- **SimulationEngine**: Manages multi-layer reasoning/simulation.
- **KASelectionEngine**: Selects which Knowledge Algorithms (KAs) to activate, based on context axes.
- **SEKREngine**: Gap analysis and dynamic ontology maintenance/enrichment (esp. detecting knowledge deficits or low-confidence areas requiring updates).
- **GraphManager (GM)**: Handles the UKG graph structure, allows lookup and dynamic graph evolution.
- **StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)**: Logs sessions, simulation outputs, confidence scores, KA outcomes, etc. Used for both process audit and historical/gap analysis.
- **UnitedSystemManager (USM)**: Unified entity/UID registry, for provenance and identity of all key objects (queries, UIDs, nodes, etc.).
- **LocationContextEngine**: Detects and maintains hierarchical location context (Axis 12), feeding this context to other components.

---

# II. Main Data Flows and Query Workflows

Below is a sequential and modular breakdown of how a typical query is processed, where new modules will be integrated, and how data is enriched/logged:

### [1] User Submits Query (Frontend ➡️ Backend)

- **Frontend** packages:
    - query: (string)
    - session/user ID
    - simulation parameters (e.g. explicit location, KA overrides, etc.)
- **Hits FastAPI**: `/api/query` (POST)

---

### [2] API Endpoint: `/api/query` → AppOrchestrator.process_request

1. **Initial Setup**:
    - Assign/verify session ID.
    - Initialize all managers/engines if not already present.
    - Create a new log entry in SMM (new session/query initiated).

2. **Initial Query Preprocessing & Axis Analysis**:
    - **ThirteenAxisQueryWorkflow** analyzes query to determine axes (domain, regulatory, location, etc.).
    - **USM**: Create a **query_topic_uid** (unique identity for semantic context).
    - **LocationContextEngine** analyzes query and parameters to set **active_location_context_uids**; these are stored in the main simulation context object (simulation_data).
    - **Log**: Store resolved axes, query_topic_uid, location context—all in SMM.

3. **KASelectionEngine Integration (NEW/ENHANCED FLOW)**:
    - Before running the main simulation, **KASelectionEngine** is called:
        - Receives axes context and current location context.
        - Decides which KAs to activate for the initial query understanding (can be context- and domain-sensitive, e.g. different KAs for "tax law" in the US vs. Germany, or for scientific vs. regulatory queries).
        - Outputs a list of selected KA numbers/identifiers.
    - **Log**: Store KA selection result in SMM.

4. **Run Selected KAs (KnowledgeAlgorithms)**:
    - For each selected KA:
        - Prepare input (includes text, axes, location, query_topic_uid).
        - Execute and collect output + KA confidence.
    - **Enrich simulation_data**:
        - Store outputs in `initial_ka_outputs`
        - Store axis context in `initial_axis_context_scores`.
    - **Log**: KA outputs and provenance in SMM.

5. **Create Full simulation_data Object**
    - Collects:
        - user query, session/user info
        - query_topic_uid
        - axes and location context
        - initial KA outputs
        - any explicit overrides or extra parameters
        - Logging/trace IDs for SMM cross-linkage

---

### [3] Main Simulation/Processing Loop

- **AppOrchestrator enters simulation loop**, passing `simulation_data` to `SimulationEngine.run_layers_1_3`.
    - Each simulation pass may involve complex multi-layer processing (L1: understanding, L2: refinement, ..., L7-L10: advanced reasoning and self-assessment).
    - Each layer may call out to KAs, GM, SMM, USM, etc.
    - After each layer or pass, updates simulation_data and logs results & derived metrics/confidence.

---

### [4] Gap Analysis for Ontology Evolution

- **SEKREngine invoked at defined intervals** (usually post-pass, or according to confidence thresholds).
    - Receives recent session summary, simulation context, SMM logs.
    - Calls:
        - **SMM**: Looks for low-confidence sessions, weakly-answered topics.
        - **GM**: Checks for sparse areas in the graph, poorly connected subtrees, unpopulated pillar levels.
        - Optionally analyzes KA performance history (from SMM KA logs).
    - **If gaps are detected**:
        - Generates proposals for ontology enrichment (add nodes, context refinements, new KA proposals).
        - (Not executing graph mutation yet, but logs these proposals.)
    - **Log**: Detailed gap detection and proposal summaries in SMM.

---

### [5] API Finalizes Simulation Data

- **Compiles final answer**, simulation status, confidence, and logs.
- **Returns response to frontend**—all relevant context (answer, confidence, reasoning steps, axis context, logging references for audits).

# IV. Cross-Module Logging Flows

### Logging/Trace Flows

- **StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)** serves as the centralized ledger for:
    - Session creation metadata
    - Axis analysis decisions (including axes, location context, query_topic_uid)
    - KA selection and invocation, with parameters and results (including confidence scores)
    - Key simulation state saves, per layer, per pass, per session
    - All gap analyses and ontology proposal events (from SEKREngine)
    - Detailed error/failure logs and system traceback for auditability
- **Traceability**
    - All main objects and events receive unique UIDs or trace IDs via USM for cross-referencing between logs, memory, and UKG state.
    - Each KA execution, selected or otherwise, is logged with context—allowing for post-hoc analysis and tuning of the KA selection policy.
- **Shared Logging ID**: Central query_topic_uid is referenced in all logs associated with a query.

---

# V. Responsibilities for Each Major Module

- **AppOrchestrator**: Orchestrates the full session/query lifecycle, delegates analysis and simulation steps, ensures all interactions are logged/auditable, aggregates outputs for API response.
- **KASelectionEngine**: Accepts context (axes, location) and performs KA (Knowledge Algorithm) selection logic, making the simulation's first pass more focused and relevant.
- **SimulationEngine**: Runs the multi-layer simulation pipeline, using prepared simulation_data (now containing initial KA results and fully realized location context).
- **SEKREngine**: Performs session/post-pass gap analysis ("are we answering too poorly? Is the ontology thin here? Are there areas of the UKG/GMs that need augmentation?"), proposes fixes.
- **GraphManager**: Underlying UKG control—essential for both answering and dynamic ontology enrichment (for future phases).
- **StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)**: Persistent, queryable session/state/analytics log; supports both runtime introspection and after-action review.
- **UnitedSystemManager (USM)**: Ensures that all key IDs, node UIDs, and entities maintain provenance and uniqueness—crucial for logging and data integrity.
- **LocationContextEngine**: Extracts hierarchical (multi-level) location context from query/user/session, so that all downstream analyses (including KAs, regulatory context, etc.) are appropriately jurisdiction-sensitive.

---

# VI. Extensibility & Dependency Documentations

- **All major modules should be importable, loosely coupled, but able to enrich shared simulation_data and SMM logs.**
- **KA Selection Engine** can be extended to:
    - Accept new axes (in config) without code changes.
    - Weight location- or domain-specific KAs as data/config evolves.
- **SEKREngine** can be upgraded with new gap analysis tests and graph enrichment strategies, as GM and SMM capabilities grow.
- **All new/experimental modules** (e.g., for Axis 12/Location context, or for personalized KA selection) should be fully modular, with clear entry points (constructor/init, main run/select methods) and internal audit logs to SMM.

---

# IX. Conclusion (for This Subtask)

You now have a thorough architectural requirements and data flow map for:

- Interplay between user-facing Next.js front-end and FastAPI backend endpoints.
- How AppOrchestrator manages the lifecycle—incorporating initial axis/location/context analysis, KA selection, and pre-simulation enrichment.
- Where the new KASelectionEngine will be invoked, enhancing targeted reasoning from the outset.
- How simulation_data (the main shared per-session object) is incrementally built up before the simulation and enriched with KA outputs, axes, and location.
- How SEKREngine can be triggered post-pass or at key decision points to analyze SMM logs and GM structure for learning and ontology refinement.
- The critical role of SMM for logging, auditability, and supporting both real-time and after-action analysis (including what data each module should be logging).
- Which modules/functions must support new hooks/extensions for next-phase enhancements (graph evolution, advanced gap detection, new axes).

You can use this as a "blueprint"/requirements checklist for implementing the described features, debugging data and logging pathways, and onboarding new engineers to the data lifecycles and responsibilities of each modular engine. 

**This analysis sets the stage for actual code implementation, modular extension, and robust logging in your full-stack, knowledge-driven simulation system.**

### Senior Python/AI Engineer, Simulation System Integrator Specialist

Certainly! Here is a thorough, implementation-oriented guide to integrating the **KASelectionEngine** into the **AppOrchestrator's initial query processing loop** in a Python FastAPI + Next.js App Router stack, as specified.

---

# KASelectionEngine Integration: AppOrchestrator Initial Query Loop

> **Goal:**  
Before the main simulation loop begins, AppOrchestrator:
- Analyzes the user query via ThirteenAxisQueryWorkflow
- Builds query_topic_uid and location context
- Invokes KASelectionEngine with this context
- Executes the selected KAs using KnowledgeAlgorithmLoader
- Logs all these steps with StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)
- Packages all outputs into initial `simulation_data`  
This enables more targeted simulation and downstream reasoning.

Below, you'll find architectural explanation, actual code scaffolding, and critical notes for extensibility and logging. This assumes your main orchestration and engine classes exist and are linked.

---

## 1. AppOrchestrator: Invocation Sequence

Place this logic in `AppOrchestrator.process_request` after the initial session and logging setup, **before** the main simulation loop.

### **Key Steps**
1. **Axis/context analysis with ThirteenAxisQueryWorkflow**  
2. **Location context resolution with LocationContextEngine**  
3. **Unique query_topic_uid generation via USM**  
4. **Invoke KASelectionEngine with axes and location**  
5. **Run each selected KA with proper input, collect outputs**  
6. **Store all outputs in simulation_data**  
7. **Log every key event to SMM with associated UIDs**

---

## 2. Sample Code Scaffold

Below is a direct implementation outline, using simple method names. Adapt for your class structures. This assumes:
- self.thirteen_axis_workflow
- self.location_context_engine
- self.ka_selection_engine
- self.united_system_manager (USM)
- self.ukg_graph_manager
- self.uskd_memory_manager (SMM)
- self.ka_loader

are all available as AppOrchestrator instance members.

## 3. Logging & Traceability Best Practices

- Every high-value "event" or data product gets a unique UID via USM; all logs reference these.
- For each major step (axis context, location, KA selection, each KA execution), log entry in SMM:
    - Use `"entry_type"` field for systematic log search/correlation.
    - Include confidence scores, input & output IDs.
- `simulation_data` object contains all next-step inputs for simulation engine **enriched with these pre-KA results**.
- All later simulation layers and gap analysis now have access to richer, targeted context—improving the entire downstream reasoning chain.

---

## 4. Extensibility, Modularity, and Location Awareness

- **KASelectionEngine**'s select method can accept additional context (axes, location, historical KAs).
- **LocationContextEngine** directly influences KA selection and the entire pipeline’s jurisdictional sensitivity.
- For domain or jurisdiction-adaptive KA choice, pass `active_location_context_uids` to both the KASelectionEngine and to each KA execution bundle.
- New axes or context sources can be easily piped in: all pipelines use single objects/dicts for simulation data and for SMM logs.

---

## 5. Frontend–Backend Integration (FastAPI + Next.js)

- The Next.js frontend calls a FastAPI route (e.g. `/api/query`) that instantiates or calls `AppOrchestrator.process_request`.
- The full simulation_data, complete with KA outputs, is returned; frontend can display reasoning steps, axes, confidence scores, and provenance data for full transparency.

---

## 6. Dependency Notes

- Ensure all modules (KASelectionEngine, LocationContextEngine, SMM, USM, KA Loader) are initialized in your `AppOrchestrator.__init__` or equivalent.
- Axis and location config, as well as KA selection policies, should be centrally maintained in config files/YAMLs to allow change without code patching.
- If you add new axes or location logic, only the modular engines and KAInputs need patching—not the core integration sequencing.

---

# CONCLUSION

**By following this pattern in your AppOrchestrator.process_request:**
- The system runs axes and location context analysis immediately on each new query,
- Selects the most relevant knowledge algorithms for that context,
- Executes them,
- Logs every step for audit and tuning,
- And builds the enriched simulation_data that all downstream simulation layers will use.

**This delivers much sharper, context-sensitive initial simulation and sets the groundwork for effective gap analysis (SEKRE), dynamic ontology management, and future administrative/analytics features.**

### AI Knowledge Engineer, Python, Graph Analytics Specialist

Certainly! Below is a detailed, implementable plan (with example Python code) for **extending SEKREngine._analyze_for_gaps in your Python app**, in line with your project's simulation/inference architecture and requirements.

# Enhanced `SEKREngine._analyze_for_gaps()`: Design & Code

## Functional Goals

- **Query SMM** for sessions/queries with low confidence, configurable by threshold.
- **Query GraphManager (GM)** for sparsely populated Pillar Level nodes via node degree/connectivity.
- **Analyze KA performance** using KA execution logs in SMM (conceptual/mock support).
- **Log** every gap detected to SMM, cross-referenced by gap and session/query, with rich metadata.
- **All thresholds/context** must be loaded from SEKRE config (support for context-aware/axis-aware triggers).
- **Return a list of gap dicts**, for downstream proposal generation.

---

## Key Requirements Mapping

- **SMM**: Must support queries like `.query_memory(entry_type, max_confidence_below=X)` and provide/retrieve KA execution log summaries.
- **GM**: Must provide `.graph.degree(uid)`, `.graph.successors(uid)`, and node attribute lookup.
- **Logging**: At every detection point (whether SMM or GM originated), a log record is added to SMM.

---

## Enhanced Method

Background assumptions:
- Your SEKREngine has: `self.smm` and `self.gm` available.
- Your config (in self.config) has:
    - `'low_confidence_query_threshold'`
    - `'sparse_node_neighbor_threshold'`
    - possibly more advanced axis/context narrowing in the future.

```python
from datetime import datetime
import random

class SekreEngine:
    def __init__(self, config, graph_manager, memory_manager, united_system_manager, simulation_validator):
        # ... as before ...
        self.config = config
        self.gm = graph_manager
        self.smm = memory_manager
        self.usm = united_system_manager
        self.simulation_validator = simulation_validator
        self.low_confidence_query_threshold = config.get("low_confidence_query_threshold", 0.90)
        self.sparse_node_neighbor_threshold = config.get("sparse_node_neighbor_threshold", 3)
        self.sekre_log_entry_type = "sekre_action_log"

    def _analyze_for_gaps(self, simulation_context_summary: dict = None) -> list:
        """
        Enhanced gap analysis function for SEKRE.
        - Checks SMM for low-confidence sessions (calls for augmentation/refinement).

## Key Implementation Points

- **Configurability:** Thresholds come from `self.config` so you can adjust via YAML config.
- **Logging:** Every gap (LOW_CONFIDENCE_AREA, SPARSE_PILLAR_DEFINITION, KA_PERFORMANCE_GAP) is logged to SMM using `add_memory_entry`, with session, pass, layer, action, and confidence.
- **Context Awareness:** Gaps include context fields (`triggering_uid_context`, `target_uid`, etc.) for downstream proposal triggers.
- **Mock/Placeholder Logic:** For KA performance and pillar sampling, more sophisticated statistics/selection can be swapped in as system matures.
- **Resilience:** All queries are surrounded by try/except so failure in one source doesn't halt the pipeline.
- **Pluggability:** Adding future checks or additional gap criteria is as simple as appending to this method.

---

## SMM and GM Supporting Functions Needed

- `smm.query_memory(..., max_confidence_below=...)`: Returns log entries below a certain confidence.
- `gm.get_pillar_level_uid(...)`: Returns pillar level node UID from name.
- `gm.graph.has_node(uid)`, `.successors(uid)`: Standard networkx graph ops.
- `gm.get_node_data_by_uid(uid)`: Returns metadata for node.
- `smm.add_memory_entry(...)`: Add log entry, includes origin/source/action for traceability.

You must ensure that these methods exist and behave as described for this code to work as-is.

---

## How this Fits Pipeline/Logging

- Called by `SEKREngine.run_evolution_cycle()` per pass, at simulation breakpoints or post-simulation.
- Gaps detected are returned to trigger ontology augmentation proposals, which are later subject to validation/integration.
- All events logged are immediately queryable in SMM for analysis or retry, and tightly coupled to their query/session/context for traceability.

---

## Where to Extend

- Add additional gap checkers (e.g., time since last update, node property completeness) by following the pattern above.
- Refine/perfect SMM queries as memory structure evolves, including time filtering, KA-specific confidence, or axis-context mentions.
- Up pluggable logging (including log-levels, destinations) as needed.

## Summary Table

| Gap Type                 | Source Queried | Threshold/Config Key             | SMM Logging Field       | Proposal Trigger Example        |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| LOW_CONFIDENCE_AREA      | SMM           | low_confidence_query_threshold   | sekre_action_log        | Add nodes/links in this context |
| SPARSE_PILLAR_DEFINITION | GM/Graph      | sparse_node_neighbor_threshold   | sekre_action_log        | Add member/sublevel to pillar   |
| KA_PERFORMANCE_GAP       | SMM/KA Logs   | *future: ka_performance_minimum* | sekre_action_log        | Propose new/augmented KA        |

---

## Next Steps

1. Add/verify SMM and GM supporting methods as described.
2. Deploy this function in `SEKREngine`.
3. Ensure SMM logs are clean, cross-referenced (with UID/session).
4. Test by creating low-confidence memory logs or sparse nodes and invoking directly or via `run_evolution_cycle`.
5. As performance data builds, replace mock KA performance triggers with real heuristics.

---

This is **modular, robust, and easily extensible**. It tightly integrates contextual, behavioral, and structural analytics for knowledge gap management in line with your system's requirements and full back-end simulation pipeline.

Let me know if you want:  
– **End-to-end test examples**,  
– **Proposal generator extension**,  
– **Mock SMM/GM implementations** to support local dev,  
– **FastAPI endpoint integration** for triggering runs/on-demand analysis.

### Python Architect, Modular API Designer Specialist

Certainly! This subtask involves **specifying new/refined interface methods** that must be present and standardized in core system modules—**StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)**, **GraphManager (GM)**, **UnitedSystemManager (USM)**, and the **Simulation Validator**—to enable everything from targeted gap analysis to actionable simulation logging and dynamic proposal/UID generation. Below is a comprehensive specification with reasoning, method signatures, and example method-level docstrings/behaviors suitable for both implementation and team handoff.

---

# 1. StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)

### 1.1. `query_memory`  
**Purpose:** Return memory entries matching filters with new support for confidence thresholds.

```python
def query_memory(self, entry_type: str = None, max_confidence_below: float = None, **kwargs) -> list:
    """
    Retrieve memory entries matching filters. 
    New: If max_confidence_below is supplied, only returns entries with
    entry['confidence'] < max_confidence_below.

    Args:
        entry_type (str, optional): The memory type (e.g., 'final_compiled_answer').
        max_confidence_below (float, optional): Upper bound on confidence to match.
        ...: Any further attribute-based filtering.

    Returns:
        List[dict]: Memory entries matching criteria.
    """
    matched = []
    for entry in self.memory_list:
        match = True
        if entry_type and entry.get("entry_type") != entry_type:
            match = False
        if max_confidence_below is not None and entry.get("confidence", 1.0) >= max_confidence_below:
            match = False
        # Additional filtering: support for session_id, uid, time range, etc.
        for k, v in kwargs.items():
            if entry.get(k) != v:
                match = False
        if match:
            matched.append(entry)
    return matched
```
**Behavior:**  
- Filters for `entry_type` (if provided).
- If `max_confidence_below` is set, only fetches entries with less-than input value.
- Additional filtering on arbitrary attributes (e.g., by axis, session, user) is supported.

**Required for:**  
- SEKRE gap analysis for finding low-confidence sessions/queries.
- KA performance checks (by confidence).

---

### 1.2. `add_memory_entry`

This likely already exists, but emphasize logging context for all detected gaps.

```python
def add_memory_entry(self, session_id:str, pass_num:int, layer_num:int, entry_type:str, 
                    content:dict, uid:str = None, confidence:float = 1.0):
    """
    Logs an event or content snapshot into the SMM.

    Args:
        session_id (str)
        pass_num (int)
        layer_num (int)
        entry_type (str)
        content (dict): The data to log (gap, action, KA result, etc)
        uid (str, optional): UID for cross-reference
        confidence (float, optional): Confidence in content.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    entry = {
        "session_id": session_id, "pass_num": pass_num, "layer_num": layer_num,
        "entry_type": entry_type, "content": content, "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    if uid: entry["uid"] = uid
    entry["confidence"] = confidence
    self.memory_list.append(entry)
```
**Required for:**  
- Reliable logging of gap detection events (with traceable session, layer, pass, etc).

---

### 1.3. (Optional) `query_ka_usage_summary`

Returns/caches aggregate KA execution stats.  
*If not implemented, KA_PERFORMANCE_GAP logic is mocked for now, but the interface should be planned.*

```python
def query_ka_usage_summary(self, ka_id: int = None, axis_uid: str = None) -> dict:
    """
    Returns a usage/performance summary for KAs, by KA and (optionally) axis.

    Args:
        ka_id (int, optional): Specific KA of interest.
        axis_uid (str, optional): Axis of interest (for context).

    Returns:
        dict: Statistics table, e.g., usage_count, avg_confidence, fail_rate, last_used.
    """
    # Example stub:
    return {"usage_count": 5, "avg_confidence": 0.87, "fail_rate": 0.2}
```

---

# 2. GraphManager (GM)

### 2.1. `get_pillar_level_uid`

```python
def get_pillar_level_uid(self, original_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Maps an original identifier (e.g., 'PL05') to its current UKG UID.

    Args:
        original_id (str): The pillar level's canonical short ID.

    Returns:
        str: The UKG UID string if found, else None.
    """
    # e.g., self.node_index['pillar_levels'][original_id] -> UID
    ...
```
**Required for:**  
- SEKREngine’s search for candidate nodes for sparsity checks, joining with SMM/USM logs, etc.

---

### 2.2. Graph Connectivity Methods

Using a standard graph attribute (often networkx), expose:

```python
# Already available if using networkx API:
has_node(uid: str) -> bool
"""
Is the given UID present as a graph node?
"""

successors(uid: str) -> list
"""
Returns a list of successor node UIDs—interpreted as 'children' or members (for PL nodes).
"""

degree(uid: str) -> int
"""
Returns the total degree (in+out) of a given node.
"""
```
**Required for:**  
- Detecting sparsely populated nodes: nodes with low numbers of successors.

---

### 2.3. `get_node_data_by_uid`

```python
def get_node_data_by_uid(self, uid: str) -> dict:
    """
    Returns full attribute dict for a node.
    """
    return self.graph.nodes[uid] if self.graph.has_node(uid) else None
```
**Required for:**  
- Returning node labels/types for more informative gap logging.

---

### 2.4. (Optional) `add_sublevel_member_to_pillar`

For proposal integration, the following method signature is recommended (though not required for this subtask):

```python
def add_sublevel_member_to_pillar(self, parent_pillar_uid: str, sublevel: str, new_member_uid: str, label: str, attributes: dict):
    """
    Adds a new sublevel member (node/edge) under a specific pillar and sublevel.
    """
    ...
```

---

# 3. UnitedSystemManager (USM)

### 3.1. `create_unified_id`

```python
def create_unified_id(self, entity_label: str, entity_type: str, ukg_coords: dict = None, specific_id_part: str = None) -> dict:
    """
    Generates a globally unique identifier with encoded axis/context and metadata.

    Args:
        entity_label (str)
        entity_type (str)
        ukg_coords (dict, optional): Axis/context dict.
        specific_id_part (str, optional): For further scoping.

    Returns:
        dict: {
            "uid_string": "...",
            "original_id": ...,
            "registry_metadata": ...,
            ...
        }
    """
    # Implementation may involve hashing or structured compositions.
    ...
```
**Required for:**  
- Generating new entity UIDs during ontology evolution (e.g., proposals for new nodes, links, KAs).

---

### 3.2. Class attribute: `uid_registry_entry_type`

**Purpose:** Each UID type logged to memory gets a registry entry for cross-traceability.

```python
@property
def uid_registry_entry_type(self):
    return "usm_uid_registry_entry"
```

---

# 4. Simulation Validator Hook

The simulation validator is responsible for scoring/ranking candidate ontology proposals during gap repair cycles.

### 4.1. `validate_proposal` (or similar)

```python
def validate_proposal(self, proposal: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Accepts a candidate proposal dict (from SEKREngine, e.g., new context node/member/KA),
    evaluates its simulation validity, and returns validation metrics.

    Args:
        proposal (dict): The proposed node/link/KA/etc.

    Returns:
        dict: {
            "proposal_uid": ...,
            "simulated_confidence": float,
            "integration_complexity_score": float,
            "potential_conflicts": int,
            # ...any side channel explanations...
        }
    """
    # Implementation is often mocked in early cycles; later stages may run true scenario-based KA validation/tests.
```
**Required for:**  
- Deciding which (if any) proposals will be auto-integrated into the UKG.

---

# 5. Example Integration for Logging

**Every time a gap is detected** in SEKREngine’s gap analysis, log with:

```python
self.smm.add_memory_entry(
    session_id=(from context or "SEKRE_CYCLE"),
    pass_num=0, layer_num=99,
    entry_type="sekre_action_log",
    content={
        "action": "detect_gap",
        "gap_detail": gap,  # full dict of detected gap (see above)
        "source": "SMM_low_conf" / "GM_sparse_pl" / "SMM_ka_perf", etc.
    },
    confidence=1.0
)
```

Gap dicts must always contain fields like:
- `gap_type`: ("LOW_CONFIDENCE_AREA", "SPARSE_PILLAR_DEFINITION", etc)
- `details`: (human-readable explanation)
- `triggering_uid_context` or `target_uid`
- `priority` (int)

---

# 6. Cross-Module Coordination & Expected Behaviors

- **All UIDs** referenced in logs must resolve to known nodes/entities in the system, or use a clear registry mechanism to permit later traceability.
- **All SMM logs** must be cross-queryable by session, pass, UID, layer, and entry type.
- **Proposal/integration hooks** (USM/GM) must be able to accept proposal dicts and perform a dry-run integration for validation.
- **Simulation Validator** must be callable as a pseudo-KA: receives proposal, outputs metrics (for now, can randomly mock results as in the main design).

---

# 7. Example Minimal Mocks/Scaffolds

For testing/bootstrapping, here are minimal mock classes showing these methods (expand as needed based on your system):

```python

# 9. Implementation Guidance

- Start by adding/filling in these methods as specified in your classes.
- Use the SMM log and query pattern as the single source of traceable system event truth.
- Structure unit/mock tests so that *gap analysis or proposal events can be traced from detection, through proposal generation, validation, and integration, all via SMM logs using session/UID references*.
- Methods should be left open to extension (for example, `query_memory` could in future accept time windows, axis, user, region, etc.).
- The Simulation Validator “hook” allows you to gradually migrate mock validation to real test/fitness functions as system maturity increases.

---

**By establishing and sticking to these interface patterns, all engines and components in your FastAPI/Next.js multi-stack simulation platform will be able to communicate, log, and coordinate evolutionary operations reliably and extensibly.**

### Python Lead Developer, Clean Code & OSS Best Practices Specialist

Certainly. To address **Subtask 5: Modularize and Future-Proof Code—Logging, Config, and Extension Points** for your Python FastAPI + Next.js simulation platform, I will:

- Show how to cleanly integrate the new logic for KA selection, gap detection, and proposal generation,  
- Ensure robust, modular, and audit-friendly logging (both for SMM and file logs as desired),  
- Illustrate a config-driven approach (for thresholds, KA selection, sparseness criteria, axis handling, etc.),  
- Highlight extensibility/extension points (for future KAs, alternate Axis 12 logic, memory engines, etc.) with in-code documentation,
- Provide example code scaffolding with comments to help your engineering team plug in further enhancements easily.

All examples assume that **Dependency Results 2–4** (interface refinements, method signatures, and core integration) have been honored in your codebase as provided.


---

# 1. CONFIGURATION-DRIVEN DESIGN

**All thresholds and key behaviors must be changeable via config (YAML or .env), not code.**

- Use a central config (dict object, e.g. parsed YAML) passed into all engines needing thresholds, mapping, or enable/disable flags.
- Sample YAML struct (ukg_app_config.yaml):

```yaml
sekre_config:
  low_confidence_query_threshold: 0.91
  sparse_node_neighbor_threshold: 2
  axis_specific_gap_policies:
    Axis12:
      spatial_sparsity_threshold: 1
    default:
      propose_new_context_node: true
kase_config:
  ka_axis_relevance_map: ...
  location_sensitive_ka_ids: [9, 16]
```

- Load this once in your FastAPI app and inject via constructors.

---

# 2. MODULAR LOGGING: TO SMM AND (OPTIONAL) FILE OR STDOUT

- **StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)** is the canonical event log for all simulation steps and engine activities.
- All `add_memory_entry` calls are centralized, so log format is consistent and rich.
- Include UID/session, context for cross-tracing.
- Add optional on-the-fly `debug_log` helper for stdout/file as desired.

**Example (within any engine):**

```python
def log_smm(self, action: str, session_id: str = "SYSTEM", details: dict = None, uid: str = None, layer_num: int = 0, confidence: float = 1.0, extra: dict = None):
    if details is None:
        details = {}
    smm_content = {"action": action, "details": details}
    if extra:
        smm_content.update(extra)
    self.smm.add_memory_entry(
        session_id=session_id,
        pass_num=0,
        layer_num=layer_num,
        entry_type=f"{self.__class__.__name__.lower()}_log",  # e.g., sekreengine_log
        content=smm_content,  # Always log a dict for queryability!
        uid=uid,
        confidence=confidence,
    )
    # Optional: also log to console/file for ops debugging
    print(f"[{datetime.now()}] [{self.__class__.__name__}] Action: {action} | Session: {session_id} | Details: {details}")
```

**In practice**:  
- Use this method throughout your engines (SekreEngine, AppOrchestrator, etc) instead of direct SMM calls, so logging shape is guaranteed even as teams modify code.
- All important workflow events (axis analysis, KA selection, gap detection, proposal results, validation status, etc) must be logged via this.

---

# 3. CODE MODULARITY: ISOLATE ENGINES AND EXTENSION POINTS

- **Engines** (SekreEngine, KASelectionEngine, LocationContextEngine, etc) should be pluggable, constructed separately, and referenced via composition (i.e., as members of AppOrchestrator or others).
- **Extension Points**:
    - Each step that involves a KA, validator, or knowledge source should call via interface/hook, not direct code.
    - All "magic numbers" (such as thresholds, list of axes handled, node sampling sizes, etc.) must be sourced from the injected config.

**Example: Extension Points in SEKRE gap analysis**

```python
class SekreEngine:
    # ... __init__ injects config, smm, gm, usm, validator, etc.

    def _analyze_for_gaps(self, simulation_context_summary: dict = None) -> list:
        gaps_found = []
        # --- Low-confidence SMM query ---
        try:
            gaps_found += self._find_low_confidence_areas(simulation_context_summary)
        except Exception as e:
            self.log_smm("low_confidence_gap_detection_failed", details={"error": str(e)})

        # --- Sparsity check ---
        try:
            gaps_found += self._find_sparsely_populated_nodes()
        except Exception as e:
            self.log_smm("pillar_sparsity_gap_detection_failed", details={"error": str(e)})

        # --- (Future) KA Performance Analysis ---
        try:
            if self.config.get("enable_ka_perf_gaps", False):
                gaps_found += self._find_ka_performance_gaps()
        except Exception as e:
            self.log_smm("ka_perf_gap_detection_failed", details={"error": str(e)})

        # --- Custom axis-specific gap detectors (future extension) ---
        for axis, policy in self.config.get("axis_specific_gap_policies", {}).items():
            _ext_point_hook = self.ext_gap_check_registry.get(axis)
            if _ext_point_hook:
                gaps_found += _ext_point_hook(self, simulation_context_summary, policy)

        return gaps_found
```

**Document every extension point in the code with docstrings and inline comments:**

```python
class SekreEngine:
    def __init__(self, config, ..., ext_gap_check_registry=None):
        """ext_gap_check_registry: Dict[str, Callable] for custom per-axis gap extensions; kept as member."""
        self.ext_gap_check_registry = ext_gap_check_registry or {}

    # ...
    # At end of _analyze_for_gaps():
    # >>> EXTENSION POINT: Other subgraphs/domain engines may register per-axis gap detectors by populating
    # SekreEngine.ext_gap_check_registry[axis_name] = callable(self, ctx_summary, policy)
```

**For location/Axis 12:**
- The LocationContextEngine is constructed with config, and can be subclassed/replaced.
- New jurisdictional logic? Just inject new engine (see Dependency Result 2).

---

# 4. FUTURE TEST EXECUTION, VALIDATION, AND LLM/KA INTEGRATION

- **Proposal validation** is handled via a clearly defined simulation_validator interface (`validate_proposal(proposal: dict)`).
- **Actual execution** is not invoked unless a feature flag in config allows it (`enable_test_execution`, `llm_validation_enabled`, etc.).
- Code calls validator via a hook (not hardcoded logic), e.g.:

```python
for prop in proposals:
    val_result = self.simulation_validator.validate_proposal(prop)
    prop["validation_metrics"] = val_result
    self.log_smm("proposal_validated", details={"proposal": prop, "result": val_result}, uid=prop.get("proposed_uid"))
    # EXTENSION POINT: Real test/LLM can be swapped into validator for deeper future validation cycles.
```

- To support future integrations (alternate memory, LLM, external microservices), write all engine interactions and cross-module I/O by interface, not by direct concrete class call.

---

# 5. PERSISTENT AUDIT: CONTEXTUAL LOGGING

- All logs must include:
    - session_id, pass_num, layer_num, uid (if relevant) → supports forensic/tracing queries
    - action/event type (string), and a details sub-structure
    - confidence (float, even if default 1.0)
    - timestamp (automatically via SMM)
    - Proposals, KAs, and gap analyses are always logged with full content for downstream review.

- **Example SMM log query**:

```python
# Find all gaps detected for a given query UID:
gaps = smm.query_memory(entry_type="sekreengine_log", uid=my_query_uid)

# Find all KA executions for a simulation pass:
ka_runs = smm.query_memory(entry_type__startswith="initial_KA", session_id=session_id, pass_num=0, layer_num=0)
```

---

# 6. CROSS-LAYER MODULARITY: PASS FORWARD ALL CONTEXT

- In all main simulation pipelines (AppOrchestrator and downward), persist and pass forward these fields in simulation_data:
    - query_topic_uid, active_location_context_uids, initial_axis_context_scores, all KA outputs, and any extra fields generated.
    - Make sure new context (such as Axis 12 additions) only requires updating simulation_data construction, not scattering changes elsewhere.

---

# 7. EXAMPLE: MODULAR, EXTENSIBLE KA SELECTION IN APPLICATOR

**(Combining modular/clean logging and config-driven operation):**

```python
class AppOrchestrator:
    def process_request(self, user_query, user_id, session_id, simulation_params=None):
        # ... axis analysis ...
        axis_context = self.thirteen_axis_workflow.run()
        location_hierarchy_uids = self.location_context_engine.determine_active_location_context(
            query_text=user_query,
            explicit_location_uids=simulation_params.get("location_uids_override") if simulation_params else None
        )
        query_uid_pkg = self.united_system_manager.create_unified_id( ... )
        query_topic_uid = query_uid_pkg["uid_string"]
        
        # Modular logging:
        self.log_smm("axis_resolved", session_id, details={"axes": axis_context}, uid=query_topic_uid)
        self.log_smm("location_resolved", session_id, details={"locations": location_hierarchy_uids}, uid=query_topic_uid)

        # Modular KA selection (inject config, pass all needed context)
        ka_selection_cfg = self.config["kase_config"]
        selected_kas = self.ka_selection_engine.select_k_a_for_task(
            axis_context, "L0_InitialQueryUnderstanding", location_hierarchy_uids, config=ka_selection_cfg
        )
        self.log_smm("ka_selection", session_id, details={"selected_kas": selected_kas}, uid=query_topic_uid)

        # Execute each KA, log result (all modular and easily rerouted for test execution, LLM, future extension)
        for ka_id in selected_kas:
            ka_input = {...}
            ka_result = self.ka_loader.execute_ka(ka_id, ka_input)
            self.log_smm(f"ka_run_{ka_id}", session_id, details={"input": ka_input, "output": ka_result}, uid=query_topic_uid)

        # Persist enriched simulation_data:
        # (add all fields, then log this as a snapshot for future debug/audit)
        simulation_data = {...}
        self.log_smm("simulation_data_snapshot", session_id, details=simulation_data, uid=query_topic_uid)
```

---

# 8. DOCUMENTATION IN CODE: EXTENSION POINTS, NOTED

Add **clear docstrings/comments at every interchange or extension point** as follows:

```python
def _find_ka_performance_gaps(self):
    """
    EXTENSION POINT:
    In future, this method can be enhanced to use full SMM KA usage stats,
    cross-join by axis, location, or other context, and propose KAs using real metrics.
    Currently, mock results may suffice.
    """
    ...
```
And:
```python
def select_k_a_for_task(self, axis_context, stage, location_uids, config=None):
    """
    Determines which KAs should be run for the current stage,
    using config (ka_axis_relevance_map etc.) and context.
    EXTEND: For new axes, new KAs, or dynamically loaded KA policies,
    simply update config and logic here—no core engine change needed.
    """
    ...
```

# 9. SUMMARY TABLE: MODULAR & FUTURE-PROOF PRACTICE

| Concern           | Practice                                          | Extension/Config Point           |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Logging           | Use SMM for every event; log UID, session, type  | SMM add_memory_entry everywhere  |
| Config            | All thresholds, policy toggles from YAML/env     | self.config in all engines       |

| Audit             | Persist all context in logs; tag with session & UID | Log simulation_data at each pass|
| Axis 12/location  | Engine composable & replaceable                  | LocationContextEngine injection  |
| Proposal/KA val   | Call by interface, not direct function           | simulation_validator hook        |
| Persistence       | simulation_data stores all initial context, KA output | Pass to downstream layers   |

---

# 10. FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

- **Never scatter logging logic or config values**; always call through a single helper per-engine/module.
- **Log entire proposal, gap, and KA result dicts, not just IDs**—this supports future replay, simulation diff, or LLM post hoc analysis.
- **All context passed in simulation_data should be forward compatible**: as you add axes, layers, KAs, etc., simply populate new keys and document their use.
- **Wherever possible**, make feature switches explicit (e.g., `enable_ka_perf_gaps`, `enable_test_execution`, `enable_llm_validation`) and default to safe/logging-only operation until tested.
- **Register per-axis or per-layer custom logic** via dictionaries of hooks/function pointers in your engine classes (`ext_gap_check_registry`, `axis_policy_hooks`, etc).

---

# 11. TL;DR: INTEGRATION PATTERN

- Use config for all nontrivial behavior, never hardcoded magic numbers.
- Use SMM for all logs. Every actionable event (axis resolved, gap detected, proposal made, KA run) = 1 log entry with strong context.
- Modularize: Engines are swappable. Validators, LLMs, even memory backends can be replaced with minimal code change.
- Mark all extension points in comments/docstrings for easier onboarding and codebase transfer.
- Pipe all new simulation/context fields into simulation_data and log snapshots at every step (for replay and audit).

---

**This ensures your KASelection + gap analysis logic is maintainable, auditable, extensible to future test/validator/LLM/axis/KAs, and robust for distributed teamwork or evolving requirements. Code examples above are ready for direct use and further engineering extension.**

## 2. Initial Query Processing & Context Enrichment

**Location in code:** `AppOrchestrator.process_request()`

- **Axis Context Analysis (ThirteenAxisQueryWorkflow):**
  - Analyzes the raw user query for semantic axes.
  - Output is a dict of relevant axes and scores per axis.
  - *Comment: This provides "topic coordinates"—critical for targeted KA selection and ontological anchoring.*
- **Location Context (LocationContextEngine):**
  - Parses explicit hints or performs NER on query for location mentions.
  - Returns a list (or hierarchy) of location UIDs—feeds Axis 12 logic.
  - *Comment: Enables precise compliance/jurisdiction simulation and KA disambiguation.*
- **query_topic_uid Generation (UnitedSystemManager):**
  - Combines axis scores and location info to create a unique identifier.
  - This UID is threaded through all logs, SMM, and simulation data.
  - *Comment: All system logs/derived entities are cross-referenced via this stable anchor.*
- **KA Selection (KASelectionEngine):**
  - Uses axes, location, and config policies to select best-suited Knowledge Algorithms (KAs) for initial understanding.
  - Stage input such as `"L0_InitialQueryUnderstanding"` enables stage- or pass-specific KA lists.
  - *Comment: Promotes "sharp" simulation—every pass uses max relevance from knowledge base.*
- **KA Execution (KnowledgeAlgorithmLoader):**
  - Runs each chosen KA, passing enriched context (axes, location, topic UID, etc).
  - Outputs stored for each KA, including `ka_confidence`.
  - *Comment: Designed for arbitrary future extension (can host LLM calls, remote microservices, etc).*
- **Logging (StructuredMemoryManager):**
  - Every key step logs event, input, output, UIDs, and confidence. Logs are SMM-queryable/auditable.
  - *Comment: Logs use explicit, structured `entry_type` fields for later tracing and replay.*

#### **Key Code Comments/Templates**

```python
# Axis analysis populates semantic dimensions
axis_context = self.thirteen_axis_workflow.run()
# LocationContextEngine determines jurisdictional overlays for compliance and simulation routing
location_hierarchy_uids = self.location_context_engine.determine_active_location_context(
    query_text=user_query, explicit_location_uids=params.get("location_override_uids") if params else None
)
# USM generates the canonical "topic UID" for all downstream referencing
query_uid_pkg = self.united_system_manager.create_unified_id(..., ukg_coords=axis_scores + location, ...)
query_topic_uid = query_uid_pkg["uid_string"]
# KASelectionEngine determines which "knowledge modules" fire before simulation, based on context/config
selected_ka_ids = self.ka_selection_engine.select_k_a_for_task(
    axis_context, stage="L0_InitialQueryUnderstanding", location_uids=location_hierarchy_uids
)
# Each selected KA receives all current context (axes, topic, location, user trace, ...)
for ka_id in selected_ka_ids:
    ka_result = self.ka_loader.execute_ka(ka_id, ka_input_dict)
    # ...log result with SMM...
# simulation_data is a dict with all above context, passed into main simulation chain
simulation_data = {...}
# All structs, especially simulation_data, are logged to SMM for cross-layer auditing and debugging
self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(..., entry_type="simulation_data_initial_snapshot", ...)
```

---

## 3. Gap Analysis & Ontology Evolution (SEKREngine)

**Triggers & Flow:**
- Called by SimulationEngine after a reasoning pass (e.g., after each simulation or on periodic schedule).
- Can also be invoked directly for QA/maintenance cycles.

### **_analyze_for_gaps Implementation**

- **SMM (StructuredMemoryManager)”**
  - Queries for sessions/outputs with low confidence (<configurable threshold).
  - Looks for performance summaries of KAs showing chronic low confidence in certain axes or locations.
- **GraphManager:**
  - Checks for sparsely connected/defined Pillar Level (PL) nodes (low child count).
  - Identifies targets for knowledge base expansion.
- **Logs every finding to SMM.**  
- **Returns gaps as standardized dicts, including `gap_type`, `details`, context UIDs, and `priority`.**

#### **Key Code Commentary**

```python
# SMM: Query for underperforming sessions (below confidence threshold)
low_confidence_entries = self.smm.query_memory(
    entry_type="final_compiled_answer", max_confidence_below=self.low_confidence_query_threshold
)
# GM: Iterating pillar nodes and sampling degree/child list—flagging those needing augmentation
for pl_uid in plausible_pillars:
    num_children = len(list(self.gm.graph.successors(pl_uid)))
    if num_children < self.sparse_node_neighbor_threshold:
        # ...propose ontology expansion...

# Each finding (gap) gets immediate, structured SMM log:
self.smm.add_memory_entry(
    session_id="SEKRE_CYCLE", pass_num=0, layer_num=99, entry_type="sekre_action_log",
    content={"action": "detect_gap", "gap_detail": gap, "source": "GM_sparse_pl"}, confidence=1.0
)
```
*Comments: All logs are structured, queryable (for downstream admin/ops analysis), and use UIDs for traceability; thresholds and rules are config-driven for policy change without code edits.*

### **Ontology Proposal Cycle**

- Each gap results in a **proposal dict** (e.g., ADD_CONTEXT_NODE, ADD_SUBLEVEL_MEMBER), with all context included.
- Proposals pass to a **simulation validator** (modular, interface-based; can be mocked/tested).
- Proposals scoring above threshold and passing integration checks are *queued for ontology upgrade* (integration is separate, can be enabled/disabled for ops/safety).

---

## 4. Modular Expansion and Extension

### **What to Extend/Plug:**
- **Axes:** Adding an axis is as simple as updating YAML config and ensuring axis context is threaded; code works with dicts for axes.
- **Location/Jurisdiction Logic:** Swap in new LocationContextEngines/NER routines as needed; all downstream steps receive location context by convention.
- **KnowledgeAlgorithmLoader and KAs:** Load new KAs, alter mapping config to axes or locations—no core engine changes required.
- **Simulation Validator/Proposal Integration:** Replace mock validator with a real fitness test, or point at microservices/LLM as the system matures.
- **SMM Backend:** The memory backend is swappable—a dict, DB, or distributed memory can replace the in-memory store with only a class swap.
- **Gap Analysis Rules:** SEKREngine supports registry of per-axis/per-domain gap checks (callable, injectable on __init__).

*See Dependency Result 5 for exact Python doc patterns for extension points.*

---

## 5. Logging & Audit Trail (StructuredMemoryManager)

### **Best Practice Pattern**

- Every key event yields an SMM log with explicit, queryable fields: session_id, pass_num, layer_num, entry_type, content, uid, confidence, timestamp.
- `entry_type` is explicit—e.g., `"axis_resolution"`, `"ka_selection_stage_0"`, `"sekre_action_log"`, `"ontology_proposal_generated"`, etc.—**for fast cross-system correlation.**
- All KA executions, axis resolutions, location resolutions, simulation_data snapshots, gap analyses, proposal generations, validations, and integrations are **independently logged** (for both troubleshooting and system provenance/audit).

### **Example Helper (for engines):**

```python
def log_smm(self, action, session_id, details, uid=None, layer_num=0, confidence=1.0):
    self.smm.add_memory_entry(
        session_id=session_id, pass_num=0, layer_num=layer_num,
        entry_type=f"{self.__class__.__name__.lower()}_log",
        content={"action": action, "details": details},
        uid=uid, confidence=confidence
    )
```
*Allows all downstream processes to be debugged or replayed, and enables future LLM-based audit/analytics.*

---

## 6. Layering, Data Propagation, and Simulation Validator Handoff

### **Layer Triggering:**
- SimulationEngine receives initial context (axes, location, KAs, query_uid, etc.) in simulation_data; **each layer can add or modify fields, always passing forward full context.**
- SEKREngine's analysis and proposal cycle can plug into post-layer trigger points *without affecting query pipeline or simulation per se*.
- All downstream logic checks for layer presence/absence and can skip, re-enter, or re-trigger as needed.

### **Simulation Validator:**
- All ontology proposals are passed through `validate_proposal(proposal: dict)`—the validator can (now, or eventually) run full test cycles, LLMs, or business rule checks.
- Output is a metrics dict (`simulated_confidence`, `integration_complexity_score`, etc.), stored both in the proposal and SMM.
- *Comment: By keeping the validator as a modular, interface-driven entity, the evolution process remains test-safe and ready for future operational upgrades.*

---

## 7. FastAPI + Next.js App Router Adaptation

- FastAPI endpoint `/api/query` calls AppOrchestrator, passing query, user id, and optional simulation params.
- **Result includes:** axis analysis, all KA outputs, enriched simulation_data, SMM log refs, and provenance UIDs.
- Next.js app calls this endpoint; can render trace/audit chain, axes, jurisdiction overlays, initial confidence, and future extensions ("view gap analysis," "propose ontology upgrade," etc.)

---

## 8. Code Comments & Doc Walkthrough (For Team Reference)

**All modules, especially AppOrchestrator, SimulationEngine, SEKREngine, and SMM, must include these patterns:**

```python
# Each step is documented for context/extension:
class AppOrchestrator:
    def process_request(...):
        # 1. Axis resolution, location context, KD selection for precise initial sim setup
        ...
        # 2. All context and outputs logged to SMM for audit/provenance
        ...
        # 3. Initial simulation_data object is always passed forward, never siloed
        ...
        # 4. Extension: To add a new axis/KA/location, only update config and per-engine registry/hook
        ...

class SEKREngine:
    def _analyze_for_gaps(...):
        """Finds global & context-specific knowledge gaps using SMM/GM.
        Returns gap dicts for ontology proposal loop.
        EXTEND: Register per-axis/domain gap policies in config for custom site/sector logic.
        """
        ...
```

## 9. Summary: System Contracts & Modularity

| Component                | Execution Contract / Modularity Principle                            |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AppOrchestrator          | All context (axes, location, KAs, UIDs) built and logged up front.  |
| SMM/MemoryManager        | Universal audit/log with strong context (all events, all layers).    |
| SEKREngine               | Pluggable gap checkers, config-driven, logs all findings as events.  |
| KnowledgeAlgorithmLoader | KAs injected/configurable, context-enriched input/output.            |
| Simulation Validator     | Proposal-check is interface-driven—mock or full sim/testable.        |
| All Engines              | Config-driven threshold/policy; injected dependencies.               |
| Proposals/Uids           | All new entities created via USM are logged and discoverable.        |
| simulation_data          | Always passed/copy-updated—add fields, don’t break core contract.    |
| Extension Points         | Explicitly documented for per-axis/per-domain logic in code.         |

# Conclusion: Your Roadmap for Robust, Auditable, and Extensible Simulation

By following the above strategy—**documented at class and method level, logging all context, and driving logic/config separation**—your platform:

- Guarantees **traceability** (every event, proposal, and layer is logged with UIDs and context)
- Supports **easy extension** (new axes, KAs, jurisdictional logic—plug and play via config and per-engine registries)
- Enables **adaptive reasoning and growth** (SEKRE gap/proposal cycles can run with or without test execution, always safe)
- **Front-to-back modularity**: Simulation, proposal, validation, and audit are decoupled, allowing for phased rollouts and evolving requirements.

**→ Engineers and admins can step into any part of the flow, trace events/proposals to context and source, and extend/replace behaviors as the ontology, knowledge algorithms, or compliance landscape evolves—**with nothing hidden or hardcoded.

# 1. Architecture & Data Flow Overview

## 1.1 Frontend-Backend Data Lifecycle

**Frontend (Next.js App Router):**
- Sends: user query (text), user/session id, params (may include location or KA overrides).

**Backend (FastAPI + Orchestrator):**
- **/api/query** endpoint calls `AppOrchestrator.process_request`, which orchestrates the following steps:

1. **Axis/context analysis** (`ThirteenAxisQueryWorkflow`): Determines query axes (regulatory, domain, location, etc).
2. **Location context extraction** (`LocationContextEngine`): Hierarchical location UIDs for Axis 12.
3. **Query topic UID creation** (`UnitedSystemManager`): Unique per-query identity, cross-logging anchor.
4. **KA selection** (`KASelectionEngine`): Chooses best-fit KAs based on axis and location.
5. **KA execution** (`KnowledgeAlgorithmLoader`): Runs algorithms, yielding confidence-tagged outputs.
6. **Enrichment of simulation_data**: All the above context/outputs are logged and packaged for simulation.
7. **Logging**: All critical steps/events are logged to `StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)`.
8. **Simulation passes** (`SimulationEngine`): simulation_data is processed through cognition layers.
9. **Gap analysis** (`SEKREngine`): At pass breakpoints or per policy, analyzes logs and graph structure to propose ontology improvements.

**SMM logs every major action, proposal, and result with UIDs, context, action type, and confidence.**

# 2. Implementation: KASelectionEngine & Initial Workflow

## 2.1 Where to Extend

- The **KASelectionEngine** integration goes immediately *after* axis analysis, location resolution, and topic UID creation, but *before* the main simulation loop in `AppOrchestrator.process_request`.
- All actions are logged, and simulation_data is built with full, enriched context.

## 2.2 Example Scaffold

```python
def process_request(self, user_query, user_id, session_id, simulation_params=None):
    # 1. Axis/context analysis
    axis_context = self.thirteen_axis_workflow.run()                  # {'resolved_axis_context': {...}}
    
    # 2. Location (Axis 12 extraction)
    explicit_loc_uids = simulation_params.get("location_uids_override") if simulation_params else None
    location_uids = self.location_context_engine.determine_active_location_context(
        query_text=user_query, explicit_location_uids=explicit_loc_uids
    )
    
    # 3. Query topic UID
    axis_scores = {
        axis: score for axis, score in axis_context.get("resolved_axis_context", {}).items()
        if score > 0.5
    }
    query_uid_pkg = self.united_system_manager.create_unified_id(
        entity_label=user_query[:60],
        entity_type="UserQueryTopic",
        ukg_coords=axis_scores,
    )
    topic_uid = query_uid_pkg["uid_string"]
    
    # 4. Logging context to SMM
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, "axis_resolution", {"axes": axis_context}, topic_uid, 0.98)
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, "location_resolution", {"locations": location_uids}, topic_uid, 1.0)
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, self.united_system_manager.uid_registry_entry_type,
        query_uid_pkg, topic_uid, 1.0)

    # 5. KA selection and logging
    selected_kas = self.ka_selection_engine.select_k_a_for_task(
        axis_context, "L0_InitialQueryUnderstanding", location_uids
    )
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, "ka_selection_stage_0", {"selected_ka_ids": selected_kas}, topic_uid, 1.0)
    
    # 6. KA execution, per-KA logging
    initial_ka_outputs = {}
    for ka_id in selected_kas:
        ka_input = {
            "raw_query_text": user_query,
            "query_topic_uid": topic_uid,
            "axis_context": axis_context.get("resolved_axis_context"),
            "active_location_context_uids": location_uids,
        }
        ka_result = self.ka_loader.execute_ka(ka_id, ka_input)
        initial_ka_outputs[f"KA{ka_id}_output"] = ka_result
        self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
            session_id, 0, 0, f"initial_KA{ka_id}_result", ka_result, topic_uid, ka_result.get("ka_confidence", 0.8)
        )

    # 7. Build simulation_data, log snapshot
    simulation_data = {
        "query": user_query, "user_id": user_id, "session_id": session_id, "current_pass": 0,
        "query_topic_uid": topic_uid, "normalized_query": user_query.lower().strip(),
        "initial_axis_context_scores": axis_context.get("resolved_axis_context"),
        "initial_ka_outputs": initial_ka_outputs,
        "active_location_context_uids": location_uids,
        "expanded_knowledge_scope_uids": [topic_uid],
        "current_confidence": 0.65,
        "primary_location_label_for_display":
            (self.ukg_graph_manager.get_node_data_by_uid(location_uids[0]).get("label")
             if location_uids else None),
    }
    self.uskd_memory_manager.add_memory_entry(
        session_id, 0, 0, "simulation_data_initial_snapshot", simulation_data, topic_uid, 1.0)
    
    # 8. Hand-off to SimulationEngine
    # simulation_data = self.simulation_engine.run_layers_1_3(simulation_data)
    # ...
```
**All thresholds, axis names, KA mappings, etc., come from config (YAML/settings) loaded at init.  
Every major event/context is logged, creating a persistent queryable audit trail.**

# 3. SEKREngine: Advanced Gap Analysis (Dynamic Evolution)

## 3.1 Extended Method Example

```python
def _analyze_for_gaps(self, simulation_context_summary: dict = None) -> list:
    gaps_found = []
    # --- 1. Find low-confidence SMM outputs
    low_confs = self.smm.query_memory(
        entry_type="final_compiled_answer",
        max_confidence_below=self.low_confidence_query_threshold)
    for entry in low_confs:
        gap = {"gap_type": "LOW_CONFIDENCE_AREA", "details": ..., "triggering_uid_context": ..., "priority": 1}
        gaps_found.append(gap)
        self.smm.add_memory_entry(..., entry_type="sekre_action_log", content={"action": "detect_gap", "gap_detail": gap, ...})
    # --- 2. Sparse Pillar nodes in GM
    for pl_uid in sample_some_pillars(self.gm):
        num_children = len(list(self.gm.graph.successors(pl_uid)))
        if num_children < self.sparse_node_neighbor_threshold:
            gap = {"gap_type": "SPARSE_PILLAR_DEFINITION", ...}
            gaps_found.append(gap)
            self.smm.add_memory_entry(..., entry_type="sekre_action_log", content={"action": "detect_gap", "gap_detail": gap, ...})
    # --- 3. (Optionally) Find underperforming KAs via SMM log stats
    ...
    return gaps_found
```
- Each gap triggers an SMM log with full detail for traceability.
- All related thresholds/configs are SMM/GM-injected via central config.
- Add extension hooks for axis/domain-specific gap checks via registry.

---

# 4. Required and Refined Interfaces: SMM, GM, USM, Validator

## 4.1 StructuredMemoryManager (SMM)
- `query_memory(entry_type=None, max_confidence_below=None, **kwargs)`: Filter for low-confidence or type-based log returns.
- `add_memory_entry(session_id, pass_num, layer_num, entry_type, content, uid=None, confidence=1.0)`: Centralized logging.
- Optional: `query_ka_usage_summary(ka_id=None, axis_uid=None)` for KA performance analytics.

## 4.2 GraphManager (GM)
- `get_pillar_level_uid(original_id)` → UID: Map pillar level names to graph UIDs.
- Graph methods: `.graph.has_node(uid)`, `.graph.successors(uid)`, `.degree(uid)`: Networkx standard.
- `get_node_data_by_uid(uid)` → dict: Node metadata for logs, proposals.

## 4.3 UnitedSystemManager (USM)
- `create_unified_id(entity_label, entity_type, ukg_coords=None, specific_id_part=None)` → dict
- `uid_registry_entry_type` (property): Type string for UID registry entries in SMM.

## 4.4 SimulationValidator
- `validate_proposal(proposal: dict) -> dict`: Returns:
    ```python
    {
        "proposal_uid": ...,
        "simulated_confidence": float,
        "integration_complexity_score": float,
        "potential_conflicts": int,
        ...
    }
    ```

---

# 5. Modularity, Logging, Config, and Extension Practices

- **All thresholds** (confidence for gaps, pillar sparsity, etc.) come from injected config.
- **All logging** is routed through SMM with a helper per engine, always referencing UID/session/layer/pass for traceability.
- **Extension Points:** 
    - New axes? Just update config and dictionaries, no hardcoding needed.
    - New location or axis-specific gap checks? Register via per-engine registries (`ext_gap_check_registry`).
    - Alternate proposal/validation logic? Swap out or layer new hooks via interface.

Driver code is kept thin; all logic is inside engines/modules, easily testable and replaceable for new features (LLMs, remote KAs, future memory backends).

---

# 6. Documentation, Extension, and End-to-End Audit

- **Code comments/docstrings** explicitly tag all extension points—future team members add axes, gap checkers, KAs, validation policies via registry or config.
- **simulation_data** is always enriched, passed to all downstream layers, never siloed—ensuring context propagation and enabling advanced auditing.
- **SMM logs** provide a persistent, queryable audit trail for every event, algorithm, and ontology evolution proposal. Each KA run, axis analysis, location resolution, gap, and proposal is cross-referenced for audit/replay/testing.
- **Validator module** is called by interface, so can be replaced by full simulation pass, LLM, or manual review in future.

---

# 7. Example: SMM/Persistent Log Query

```python
# Audit all gaps/detections for topic_uid 'XYZ'
gaps = smm.query_memory(entry_type="sekre_action_log", uid="XYZ")
# Find all KA runs for session X
ka_runs = smm.query_memory(entry_type__startswith="initial_KA", session_id="X")
```

| Proposal/validation             | SimulationValidator, USM | SMM (proposals)   | Swap validator, change logic/hooks |

---

# 9. Next Steps and Best Practices

- **Implement/verify required interfaces** in SMM, GM, USM, and validator (see specs above).
- **Register all logs and important events** with UIDs/session and typed entry fields in SMM.
- **Load all config** for thresholds/policies from central YAML or .env—never hardcode criteria.
- **Clearly document** all extension points in code, and keep simulation_data design forward-compatible.
- **Test gap analysis/proposal cycles** with mock/test data, ensure logs are queryable.
- **When integrating new axes/KAs/inference layers**, only update config + extension registries, not orchestration skeleton.
